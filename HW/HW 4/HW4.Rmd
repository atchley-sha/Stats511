# 4.3
Removing the zeros from the dataset would completely alter the data and therefore change the results (especially when there are so many zeros). Either a small value should be added to all the observations if a log transformation is still desired, or a different method should be used.

# 4.10
The cutoff of $p=0.05$ is essentially arbitrary; there's no intrinsic reason that a 5% chance of something happening is significant while a 6% chance is not. In this case, the two _p_-values are so similar that they tell the same story: there is around a 5% chance that these results would occur due to pure randomness if the null hypothesis were true. As such, it's better to report and discuss the _p_-value itself rather than a simple "yes/no" of significance.
